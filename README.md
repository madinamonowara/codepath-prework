## Required Functionality

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [x] Game interface has a heading (h1 tag), a line of body text (p tag), and four buttons that match the demo app
* [x] "Start" button toggles between "Start" and "Stop" when clicked. 
* [x] Game buttons each light up and play a sound when clicked. 
* [x] Computer plays back sequence of clues including sound and visual cue for each button
* [x] Play progresses to the next turn (the user gets the next step in the pattern) after a correct guess. 
* [x] User wins the game after guessing a complete pattern
* [x] User loses the game after an incorrect guess

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [ ] Any HTML page elements (including game buttons) has been styled differently than in the tutorial
* [ ] Buttons use a pitch (frequency) other than the ones in the tutorial
* [ ] More than 4 functional game buttons
* [ ] Playback speeds up on each turn
* [ ] Computer picks a different pattern each time the game is played
* [ ] Player only loses after 3 mistakes (instead of on the first mistake)
* [ ] Game button appearance change goes beyond color (e.g. add an image)
* [ ] Game button sound is more complex than a single tone (e.g. an audio file, a chord, a sequence of multiple tones)
* [ ] User has a limited amount of time to enter their guess on each turn

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app!

## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 

[https://www.tutorialgateway.org/javascript-nested-if/] 

[https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_if_else.asp]

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 

[The last part of part 9, where I had to write nested conditional loop statements in Javascript was the most challenging for me as I don't have a ton of experience writing nested conditional loop statements in Javascript. I first went at it by thinking about how would I write this in another language where I do know how to write nested conditional loops and while that did help some, that ended up complicating my thought process. After doing a review of how it's done in Javascript, the final answer was more condensed, easier, and clearer than the one I was brainstorming in my head which was a nice conclusion. Honestly, it was just me complicating it in my head more than it should be but a good note for the future would be to do the research in the language I'm actually writing in first. In the future when I reach the point where I have enough experience in multiple languages, connecting the patterns I see that are parallel or similar in different languages would be more efficient but not when I'm still very much in the early learning phase of coding journey.]

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 

[One thing I noticed while creating this submission was that there was a lot of back and forth between files and a couple of features wouldn't be able to work if I didn't go into two different files that are written in two different languages first, which I found really interesting.]

[My Questions:
For more complex and bigger projects, how do web developers keep track of all of this? Can there be multiple HTML and CSS files and JS files under those projects? If there's a group of web developers contributing to and creating a big complex project together, what are the workflows and processes set in place to make the process easier for everyone?]

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 

[If I had a few more hours to work on this project, I would add additional features such as a point feature for users (you collect more points depending on how long you were able to continue to follow the pattern). Adding both images (landscape images, memes, simple icons, etc.) and changing the shapes of the buttons themselves (stars, apples, circles, etc.) would be a cool addition. Another cool feature would be changing the sound each button is connected to a selection of indie songs would be very fun too. It's more interesting to listen to and people are being introduced to new artists at the same time.]

[Another feature, although advanced even for me, I would love to add is a scoreboard that tracks and allows you to see how many points others have collected and who currently has the highest amount of points.]

[Unrelated but some non-technical improvements my brain thought of (feel free to disregard):

[From a marketing standpoint though, what would make a light and sound memory game interesting enough to convince players to keep coming back & collect more points?]

[Inspired by a rice game that allows you to donate grains of rice just by playing simple games ([https://freerice.com/about]) and a close friend my age who makes it a point to solve crossword puzzles and other memory strengthening games every day as a preventative measure she takes against the Alzheimers Disease that runs in her family: In conjunction with the Alzheimer Association of America (or another Alzheimers nonprofit), each point and/or level you unlock will be worth money which is then donated to these organizations.]
